# Project Proposal
#### Alexis Wu

## Main Idea
To train a computer vision model based on hand pose and have the neato react to it.

## Learning Goals
- Develop a CNN algorithm in machine learning.
- Learn about transfer learning rather than training a whole neural network from scrach.
- Learn about object tracking, specifically on hand poses.

## MVP 
The minimal viable product of this project will be successfully train a neural network that could tell 2 or 3 different hand poses, without neato implementation because the main learning goal would be about transfer learning and object tracking.

## Strech Goal
The strech goal is to have the neato react to more hand poses like stop, go, left turn, right turn from an away distance.


## What do you view as the biggest risks to you being successful on this project?
Neural networks sometimes do not act in the way we expect it to be and might just don't work.

## What might you need from the teaching team for you to be successful on this project?
More lectures/ demos on CNN would be really helpful.
